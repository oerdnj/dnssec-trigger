	  the pango-basic-win32.dll and gdk png loader dll (if present)

	- get a probe after start on OSX.
	- fix submit of disconnect state, submit "".
	- fix resolvconf writes on OSX: more chance of winning resolv.conf
	  which is a small race what with setting scutil at the same time,
	  and sets it after userlogin because OSX reprobes at user login.

8 Sep 2011: Wouter
	- Fix that windows DHCP hook fires less often: only if list of network
	  and GUID of adapter and IPs changes.
	- unbound-control execute hook.
