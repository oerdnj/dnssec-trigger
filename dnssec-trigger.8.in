.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The \fBdnssec\-trigger\fR programs steer \fIunbound\fR(8)
towards DNSSEC capable DNS servers.  A DHCP hook installed on the
system calls \fBdnssec\-trigger\-control\fR that contacts the daemon
\fBdnssec\-triggerd\fR that probes the list of servers.  The daemon then
adjusts a running unbound through \fIunbound\-control\fR(8) and notifies
the user applet \fBdnssec\-trigger\-panel\fR for GUI display.
.SH "THE DNSSEC\-TRIGGERD DAEMON"
.LP
Thus the dnssec\-triggerd daemon runs continually, and is started after
boot.  It receives a list of IP addresses, probes them, and adjusts
unbound and resolv.conf.  Unbound acts as the validating local resolver,
running on 127.0.0.1.  And resolv.conf is modified to point to 127.0.0.1.
.TP
.B \-c\fI cfgfile
Set the config file with settings for the dnssec\-triggerd to read
instead of reading the file at the default location, 0configfile0. The
syntax is described below.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug flag, do not fork into the background, but stay attached to the console.
.TP
.B \-v
Increase verbosity. If given multiple times, more information is logged.
This is in addition to the verbosity (if any) from the config file.
.B
.P
The dnssec\-trigger\-panel runs after user login, displays notifications and
status to the user.  It may popup a warning if no DNSSEC capable servers
are available, with options to disconnect or to connect insecurely.
.P
The dnssec\-trigger\-control tool is used in the background by scripts to
notify the daemon of new (DHCP) DNS servers.  It can be used to test the
system by providing a (fake) list of DNS server IP addresses.
.P
The \fBdnssec\-trigger\-control\-setup\fR tool is used to setup the SSL keys
that the daemon and user panel use to communicate securely.  It must be run
once after installation.
.SH "THE DNSSEC\-TRIGGER.CONF FILE"
.LP
The config file contains options.  It is fairly simple, key: value.
You can make comments with '#' and have empty lines.  The parser is
simple and expects one statement per line.
.TP
.B verbosity: \fR<num>
Amount of logging, 1 is default. 0 is only errors, 2 is more detail,
4 for debug.
.TP
.B pidfile: \fR"<file>"
The filename where the pid of the dnssec\-triggerd is stored.  Default is 0pidfile0.
.TP
.B logfile: \fR"<file>"
Log to a file instead of syslog, default is to syslog.
.TP
.B use\-syslog: \fR<yes or no>
Log to syslog, default is yes.  Set to no logs to stderr (if no logfile) or
the configured logfile.
.TP
.B unbound\-control: \fR"<command>"
The string gives the command to execute.  It can be "unbound\-control"
to search the runtime PATH, or a full pathname.  With a space
after the command arguments can be configured to the command,
i.e. "/usr/local/bin/unbound\-control \-c my.conf".
.TP
.B resolvconf: \fR"/etc/resolv.conf"
The resolv.conf file to edit (on posix systems).  The daemon keeps the file
readonly and only make it writable shortly to change it itself.  This is
to keep other software from interfering.  On OSX (if compiled in) also the
DNS settings are changed in the runtime network configuration machinery,
but because this is also where the DHCP info comes from there may be periods
where the DNS server override does not exist.
.TP
.B domain: \fR"example.com"
The domain to set in resolv.conf.  See \fIresolv.conf\fR(5).  Picked up
once during installation, and not from DHCP since it allows directing
traffic elsewhere.
.TP
.B search: \fR"example.com"
The domain name search path to set in resolv.conf.  See \fIresolv.conf\fR(5).
Picked up once during installation, and not from DHCP since it allows
directing traffic elsewhere.
.TP
.B noaction: \fR<yes or no>
Default is no.  If yes, no action is taken to change unbound\-control or
resolv.conf.  The probe results are available for inspection.
.TP
.B port: \fR<8955>
Port number to use for communication with dnssec\-triggerd.  Communication
uses 127.0.0.1 (the loopback interface).  SSL is used to secure it,
and the keys are stored on the disk (see below).  The other tools read this
config file to find the port number and key locations.
.TP
.B server\-key\-file: \fR"0keydir0/dnssec_trigger_server.key"
.TP
.B server\-cert\-file: \fR"0keydir0/dnssec_trigger_server.pem"
.TP
.B control\-key\-file: \fR"0keydir0/dnssec_trigger_control.key"
.TP
.B control\-cert\-file: \fR"0keydir0/dnssec_trigger_control.pem"
The files used for SSL secured communication with dnssec\-triggerd.  These
files can be created with dnssec\-trigger\-control\-setup (run as root).
.TP
.B tcp80: \fR<ip>
Add an IP4 or IP6 address to the list of fallback open DNSSEC resolvers that
are used on TCP port 80.
.TP
.B tcp443: \fR<ip>
Add an IP4 or IP6 address to the list of fallback open DNSSEC resolvers that
are used on TCP port 443.
.SH "THE DNSSEC\-TRIGGER\-PANEL"
The dnssec\-trigger\-panel is an applet that runs in the tray.  It shows
the DNSSEC status.  It can be invoked with \-d to test in the build
directory.  The \-c \fIcfgfile\fR option can set the config file away
from the default.  The applet keeps an SSL connection to the daemon
and displays the status, and can show the user dialogs.  The applet
has a small menu.  The menu item \fBReprobe\fR causes the daemon to
probe the last seen DHCP DNS servers again, which may now work after a
hotspot signon.  The \fBProbe Result\fR menu item shows the results of the
previous probe to the user, for technical help with network difficulties.
.SH "THE DNSSEC\-TRIGGER\-CONTROL TOOL"
The dnssec\-trigger\-control tool can be used to test.  It is also used
inside DHCP scripts (platform specific).  It can send commands to the daemon.
.PP
Options:
.TP
.B \-c \fIcfgfile
Set the config file to use away from the default.
.TP
.B \-s \fIip[@port]
Default connects to 127.0.0.1 with the port from config file, but this
options overrides that with an IPv4 or IPv6 address and optional a port.
.TP
.B \-v
increase verbosity of dnssec\-trigger\-control.
.PP
Commands:
.TP
.B submit \fR<ips>
Submit a list of space separated IP addresses (from DHCP) that are the DNS
servers that the daemon will probe.  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be used.
.TP
.B unsafe
Test command that probes some 127/8 addresses in a way that makes the daemon
conclude that no DNSSEC works.  Presents user with 'Insecure?' dialog.
.TP
.B status
Shows the last probe results.
.TP
.B reprobe
Probe the last probe again.  It also cancels forced insecure state from
hotspot signon, causing probes for dnssec to resume.  This command acts
as the menu item with the same name.
.TP
.B hotspot_signon
This command acts as the menu item with the same name.  Use it to force
insecure mode, where you can then interact with (weird) hotspot set ups.
When you are done, do the reprobe command to resume DNSSEC.
.TP
.B results
continuous feed of probe results.
.TP
.B cmdtray
Continuous input feed, used by the tray icon to send commands to the daemon.
.TP
.B stoppanels
Makes connected tray icons quit.  Useful for installers that need to
update their executable.
.TP
.B stop
stops the daemon.
.SH "THE DNSSEC\-TRIGGER\-CONTROL\-SETUP TOOL"
This tool aids setup of files.  Without arguments it creates the key files.
If key files already exist, it resigns certificates with existing private keys.
With \-d dir the files are placed in the given directory.
.PP
With \-i the tool changes configuration files.  It tests if unbound has
\fBremote\-control\fR: \fBcontrol\-enable\fR: yes and if not appends
lines to unbound.conf that enable unbound\-control, and it runs
unbound\-control\-setup to generate the keys for unbound\-control.
It tests if unbound has a trust anchor, if not it enables the root.key as
\fBauto\-trust\-anchor\-file\fR and runs \fIunbound\-anchor\fR(8) to
initialize the key.  It picks up the domain and search from resolv.conf and
configures the dnssec\-trigger.conf to use that.
.PP
Note the tool trusts the domain and search path at install time.  You should
review them or perform configuration manually.
.PP
With \-u it removes the options it enabled in \fIunbound.conf\fR(5).
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I 0configfile0

Directory with keys used for SSL connections to dnssec\-triggerd.
